code-review
-----------

This is largely just a wholesale copy of [rjbs's awesome code-review script](http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/2007) with just a few slight changes.

I'm nowhere as busy as rjbs and have nowhere near as many dists as him but being able to run one command to make sure I haven't overlooked any RT tickets, GitHub issues, or outstanding Kwalittee fails is awesome for laziness.
